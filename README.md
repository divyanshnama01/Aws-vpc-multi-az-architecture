# Aws-vpc-multi-az-architecture
Welcome to my end-to-end AWS infrastructure deployment project. This repository documents the process of designing and deploying a **highly available, secure, and scalable application environment** using core AWS services within a custom-built VPC.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This architecture is built with the goal of simulating a **production-grade environment** with real-world considerations for scalability, availability, and security.

### üîß Key Components:
- Custom VPC (IPv4)
- Public and Private Subnets (Multi-AZ)
- Internet Gateway (IGW)
- NAT Gateways (High Availability)
- S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- EC2 Instances in Auto Scaling Group
- IAM Roles for secure access
- Security Groups for tight access control

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Breakdown

### 1. VPC & Subnets
- VPC with /16 CIDR block
- 2 Public subnets and 2 Private subnets across **2 Availability Zones**

### 2. Routing & Access Control
- **Internet Gateway** attached to VPC
- **NAT Gateways** in each public subnet
- Custom Route Tables for public/private traffic routing

### 3. Security
- Separate **Security Groups** for ALB and EC2
- IAM Role with permissions for EC2 to access S3
- **No direct internet access** to EC2 instances (private subnets only)

### 4. Compute & Load Balancing
- EC2 instances launched into private subnets via **Auto Scaling Group**
- **Application Load Balancer** manages incoming traffic and health checks
- ASG handles horizontal scaling based on CPU utilization

### 5. S3 Gateway Endpoint
- VPC Gateway Endpoint configured for secure and cost-effective S3 access from private subnets

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline + CodeDeploy
- Implement monitoring via CloudWatch dashboards
- Extend to multi-region for disaster recovery
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform or AWS CDK
